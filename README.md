## Highlights
- Propose a physics-embedded recurrent-convolutional neural network (PeRCNN), which forcibly embeds the physics structure to facilitate learning for data-driven modeling of nonlinear systems
- The physics-embedding mechanism guarantees the model to rigorously obey the given physics based on our prior knowledge
- Present the recurrent Ï€-Block to achieve nonlinear approximation via element-wise product among the feature maps
- Design the spatial information learned by either convolutional or predefined finite-differencebased filters
- Model the temporal evolution with forward Euler time marching scheme


### Training and extrapolation results
We show the reconstruction and extrapolation performance of our PeCRNN on 2D Gray-Scott equation below:

## Datasets
Due to the file size limit, we attach the google drive [[link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1uZd7_OtbWuBJ0j-guJ0Ddva2V7nQ2VTM)] to download the datasets.


## Models
- PeRCNN model is provided under folders for each dataset
- misc/2d_burgers_ablation contains (part of) models for ablation study
- misc/xx_baselines contains baselines (ConvLSTM, DHPM, ResNet)


## Requirements
- pytorch>=1.6 is recommended
- plotly is needed to plot isosurface for 3D case
- TF 1.0 is required for DHPM
