1. pytorch>=1.6 is recommended. plotly is needed to plot isosurface for 3D case. TF 1.0 is required for DHPM. 
2. PeRCNN model is provided under folders for each dataset
3. misc/2d_burgers_ablation contains (part of) models for ablation study
4. misc/xx_baselines contains baselines (ConvLSTM, DHPM, ResNet)
